# Assistance_for_visually_impaired

In the folder named "Project_code", there is the code for the arduino on the blind stick. Then it has a "colordetection" folder which can detect the color red. This can help the visually impaired to know if the signal in the crossing is red and he has to stop before crossing. The "facialreco_project" has a facial recognition model to detect known faces to help the visual impaired to know if someone he/she knows is around.
